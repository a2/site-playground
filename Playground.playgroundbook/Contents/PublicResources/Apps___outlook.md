title: Microsoft Outlook

I started working on [Outlook for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8) after changing teams from [To Do](#to-do) in January 2020. I led calendar/time management and push notifications work. I collaborated closely with other stakeholders like product and design to build productivity experiences for users. I implemented features like "Ignore Conversation" (which sends an email conversation and all future replies to the Trash folder, perfect for that "reply all" chain that just won't stop), calendar week number support, as well as prototypes for and initial versions of suggested meeting times.
