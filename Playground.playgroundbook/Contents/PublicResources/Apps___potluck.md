title: Potluck, Branch
---

I joined the Branch team as lead mobile engineer after my internship at [Foursquare](#foursquare) in summer 2013. While there, I implemented the second version of the Potluck iOS client, a link-sharing social network for friends to discuss online content. I also wrote a spin-off app, called PhoneTag, a voicemail style app where friends send each other voice memo-captioned images.

For maximum nostalgia, the screenshot to the left has not been modified from its original version.
