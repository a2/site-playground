title: Backgammon with Buddies
---

Growing up, playing Backgammon was a tradition with my family. I am especially fond of memories sitting around a board and playing it at the beach. When I moved to Europe, away from them, I missed these moments. I decided that I wanted to build my own version of the backgammon for iOS, so I could play with my family even when we were apart. I then had the idea of building an iMessage-based turn-by-turn version, so it would be easy to get everybody set up. That’s why I called it "Backgammon with Buddies."

I spent a lot of time working on the details of the board, such as the felt, the woods and the shadows, to recreate the experience I remembered. I later added support for Game Center so you can play with remote Buddies. In working on this app, I learned a lot about the _actual_ rules of Backgammon, and I even went the extra mile with accessibility, because I wanted everybody to be able to play the game. I gave a talk about working on the accessibility features of Backgammon with Buddies in German ([_hier Video auf Deutsch ansehen_](https://macoun.de/video2019/ts5.php)) at Macoun, Europe’s largest conference for German-speaking Apple developers.
