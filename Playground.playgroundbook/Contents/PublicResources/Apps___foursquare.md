I was an intern at Foursquare during summer 2013 as part of my [hackNY](https://hackny.org) fellowship. While I was familiarizing myself with the codebase, I performed tests to quantify the battery drain effects of background location monitoring to surface useful tips for nearby restaurants and other venues. A few weeks into the internship, Apple announced radical visual design changes as part of the iOS 7 release. For the rest of the summer, I worked closely with other iOS engineers as well as the design team to modernize the appearance of the Foursquare iOS client with these new interface design patterns.
