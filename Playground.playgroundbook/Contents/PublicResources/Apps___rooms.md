title: Rooms, Facebook
---

I worked on Rooms at Facebook as part of the Facebook Creative Labs efforts in 2014 following the Branch acquisition. My involvement spanned from product conception to engineering efforts as well. As one of the few engineers on this team, I not only contributed to the mobile app by writing code for the iOS codebase but also server-side JavaScript that ran on our Parse-powered backend. (Parse was a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> start-up turned Facebook product that powered the Rooms backend.) My contributions were focused on building novel interactions, and delightful animations and interfaces. When I moved off the Rooms team in January 2015, I worked on the React Native project as a core contributor until I left Facebook later that year.
