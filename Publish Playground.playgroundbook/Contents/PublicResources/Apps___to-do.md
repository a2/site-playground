title: Microsoft To Do
---

I worked on the To Do client apps for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790?mt=8) and [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1274495053?mt=12) while continuing maintenance for the Wunderlist apps. Part of that was leading feature work on features like file attachment support on tasks and list sharing. I also led the feature crew to ship the native 100% AppKit macOS app, while adopting To Do's new visual design. We ensured optimal support for Apple's assistive technologies such as Voice Over, Switch Control on iOS, as well as correct tab control on macOS. To Do was featured by Apple as [_App of the Day_ on iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1479788004) and in the article [_From To-Do to To-Done!_](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1481379749) for macOS.
