title: Bean, Small Planet
---

During my internship at Small Planet, I wrote the original version of the [Bean](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bean-a-counting-app/id551418848) virtual counting assistant app. I learned for the first time what it would be like to work at a company with other engineers, with designers and product managers. I collaborated with others, like design and product mangement, to showcase the craft and attention that Small Planet is able to put into the products they work on. I also added some telemetry tracking to the [Dragon Brush](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dragon-brush/id525049909) storybook app for iPad. I also got to code custom controls and in-game aesthetics for Disneyland Explorer. 

For maximum nostalgia, the screenshot to the left has not been modified from its original version.
