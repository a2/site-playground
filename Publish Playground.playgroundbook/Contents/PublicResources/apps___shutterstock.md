I worked at Shutterstock on both iOS client apps. [Shutterstock Contributor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shutterstock-contributor/id913214324) allows contributors to manage image metadata for their submissions, upload new submissions from their phoneâ€™s camera roll, and view both daily and monthly commission earnings. On the consumer side,  [Shutterstock](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shutterstock-stock-photos/id473347409) allows customers to search for, view, organize and purchase high-quality stock photography. I learned a lot from our advanced use of Core Data in production for data persistence. I implemented features like Siri photo search in the consumer app and background photo upload via a Share extension in the contributor app.
