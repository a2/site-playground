As a language learner — nay, language enthusiast! — I have often found that the best way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it. I did this by making the [Bablegum](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/babelgum-translator/id1412706772?ls=1) app for iOS. It allows me to read and learn foreign langauge text with inline translation capabilities. You can also save articles for offline reading from apps like Safari through the Share extension or load articles in-app from a URL or from your device's clipboard. Through making this app, I learned a lot about iOS's text rendering system (which allowed me to display [_Furigana_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana)-like annotations above text) as well as using iOS UI testing methods to generate screenshots in various screen sizes and configurations.
