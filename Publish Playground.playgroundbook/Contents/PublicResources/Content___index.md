I’m a **Software Engineer** specializing in Apple platform technologies. I love to create polished visuals and delightful experiences that users love. I work at Microsoft in New York City, helping people achieve more with Outlook Mobile for iOS.

I’m an avid learner of languages, both human and for computer programming. I’m an English native speaker but also proficient in Spanish, French, and German. I gave a talk at Macoun, Europe’s largest conference for German-speaking Apple developers, in Frankfurt in October 2019.

I’m most knowledgeable in Swift as well as Objective-C. You might also find me writing little sites like this with HTML and CSS or scripts in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, or even Bash. I’ve also dabbled with Lua within the PICO-8 fantasy console to make some smaller projects.

Feel free to poke around my interactive portfolio on the iPhone to the left. If you want to get in touch, the [_Mail app_](#mail) is a great place to start.
